I am a professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at NJIT. My research applies methods of dynamical systems to (conservative, dispersive) nonlinear wave equations arising, for example, in optics and fluid mechanics. I am interested in dynamical and bifurcation phenomena, and I use techniques from Hamiltonian mechanics and perturbation theory, as well as extensive computations. My current research in vortex dynamics is supported by the NSF under [DMS-2206016](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2206016&HistoricalAwards=false).
