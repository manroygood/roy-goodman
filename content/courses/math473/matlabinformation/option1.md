### MATLAB dfield and pplane

**Instructions**

1. Download {{% staticref "math222/matdfpp.mlappinstall"%}} ðŸ“„ This File{{% /staticref %}} and move it to a folder where you want to keep it.
2. Open the file by double clicking on its icon. This will open MATLAB and install a new program **matdfpp** into the **Apps** tab at the top of the MATLAB Desktop.
3. Click on the **Apps** tab on the MATLAB Desktop and then on the app **matdfpp.**
4. This will open a new window with two buttons. The left one draws direction fields (Assignment 1) and the right one draws phase planes (Assignment 4).

1. In the window that pops up, enter the equation and change the parameters and axis limits as needed to make things look good. Click on the "Graph Phase Plane" button.
1. Clicking on the coordinate $(t_0,x_0)$ in the window that pops up will draw a solution that goes through that point. Do this in a few places, until you get a reasonable idea of what the trajectories look like.  
1. **How to make good looking graphics:**  (This is annoying but will make your output much better.) Click **File $\to$ Export Setup** in the graphics window. In the window that pops up, click **Export**. In the next window that pops up choose a format that you can import into a document, such as Portable Network Graphic (png) and save it to a file. It's best not to use screenshots or :scream: take a photo of your computer screen.
