[__Prof. Roy Goodman__](mailto:goodman@njit.edu) __Course Coordinator__

The [syllabus](https://math.njit.edu/spring-2021-course-syllabi) is the most important thing!

### Prerequisites 
Math 222 is considered a tough class by many NJIT students. Before undertaking this class, it is important that you are confident in the prerequisites.  Make sure that the material in these three files doesn't seem too foreign to you.
1. [Calculus Review](Review/calculus.pdf)
1. [Linear Algebra Review](Review/linearAlgebra.pdf)
1. [General Differerential Equations Models](Review/general.pdf)

### MATLAB

Over the semester there are four MATLAB Laboratory Assignments. 

See the [main MATLAB page](matlabInformation) for more details.

For help using MATLAB, talk to your instructor or see a tutor during MATLAB tutoring hours at the Math Tutoring Center, described below.

### Math tutoring center

The Math tutoring center has online tutoring in all 100 and 200 level math classes. You can drop in whenever it's open or make an appointment. There are special hours for MATLAB questions. All the information about the tutoring center is available [here](http://www.njitmtc.com/).

### Exams from past semesters
*Warning: Different coordinators may add or remove topics from the syllabus from year to year, or place different value as to what material is most important. In addition, the exam schedule varies slightly each semester, so what might appear on Exam 2 last semester could be on Exam 1 this time. In general, the homework on the syllabus is your best guide.*

The math department hosts old exams [here](http://math.njit.edu/students/undergraduate/course_exams.php)

In addition, here are the exams that I have given in recent semesters 
* Fall 2017

### Supplementary material for Chapter 10
* [Useful Fourier Series Demo in MATLAB](https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/matlab/) Most of the material here is more advanced. Scroll down until you find __Fourier Series Demo__.
* [Material for Section 10.1](supplements/supplement10p1) On boundary value problems with nonhomogeneous term on the right hand side.
* [Material for Section 10.4](supplements/supplement10p4) On the use of Fourier sine series to solve boundary value problems.
