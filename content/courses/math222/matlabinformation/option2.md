### Java Software from University of New Mexico

This is a freestanding program that doesn't require MATLAB. It's nicer than the MATLAB program above, because it allows you to define parameters that you can vary from within the GUI, but the graphical output is very rough.

1. If you don't already have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer, download one [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html).
1. Download pplane and dfield from [here](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~joel/dfield/). 
1. Double click on the file **dfield.jar** (assignment 1) or **pplane.jar** (assignment 2). Your JRE should open it.
1. Note that it allows you to change parameters right in the window (dfield shown here, pplane looks similar). In this example, there are parameters **a** and **b**.

1. You can print the solution to a PDF from the *file* menu in the graphics window.
