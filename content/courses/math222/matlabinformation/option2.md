### Slopes app
This is an app for iPhones and iPads so it doesn't require you to use MATLAB. They've just released a version for Android. It's missing some advanced features but it has enough for the two assignments. The app is super easy to use and it outputs really nice pictures. Obviously, it works somewhat nicer on a tablet than on a phone, so if you have one, use it.
1. Find it [here](https://sites.google.com/a/pepperdine.edu/slopes/). Use the App Store or Google Play store to download to your device.
1. For assignment 1 you should click the button for **slope fields**. For assignment 2 click the button for **phase planes**.
2. Export your results to PDF or PNG format to include in your writeup.
