### Phase Plane with GUI for 1st and 2nd order ODE
It can be downloaded [here](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/62216-phase-plane-with-gui-for-1st-and-2nd-order-ode).


To use it:
1. Download the program and save it somewhere on your computer.
1. Start up MATLAB.
1. Make sure that MATLAB is opened to the folder where the software is saved.

1. At the `>>` prompt, type `pplane1` (Assignment 1) or `pplane2` (Assignment 2).
1. In the window that pops up, enter the equation and change the parameters as needed to make things look good. Click on the "Graph Phase Plane" button.
1. Click on the graphics window that pops up in a few places, until you get a reasonable idea of what the trajectories look like. You will see the trajectories with $t>0$ in blue and the parts with $t< 0$ in red.
1. Click "File $\to$ Save As" and export the image to a JPG or PNG file to print out and turn in. **Pro tip:** Always export graphics to a file and never use a screenshot in anything you turn in or write. Doing the latter will make you look like an incompetent amateur. :smile:
