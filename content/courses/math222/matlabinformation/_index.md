##Downloading

MATLAB is available in most campus computer labs or for downloading to your personal computer, following the instructions on the [IST Software Downloads page](https://ist.njit.edu/software-available-download#m). An in-broswer version of MATLAB is also available at [MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com) and won't require you to download it. (Warning: I have not tried to use the add-on software for assignments 2 & 4 in the online version.) Either option will require you to create a MATLAB account with your NJIT email address.

## Learning to use MATLAB

MATLAB is used in many places in the NJIT curriculum. It's in your interest to learn to use it well. The Mathworks (creators of MATLAB) offer a variety of self-taught courses on the website [MATLAB Academy](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com). I highly recommend the course __MATLAB Onramp__, especially transfer students who haven't used the software before.

## A Note on the assignments

The assignments this semester are slightly modified in comparison with last semester. The two long assignments from the fall have been lightly edited and split into four shorter assignments. The total workload is essentially unchanged, but this should prevent procrastinators from getting overwhelmed. Assignment 3 involves no computing, but contains modeling and theory that will prepare you for computational work in Assignment 4.

## MATLAB Programming

Assignments 2 & 4 contains a programming component. To do this component, you should download the live scripts linked in the assignments and modify the example code to do the assigned exercises. 

In MATLAB, there exist two types of program files. 

* __Scripts__ are the basic program files. Their filenames end in __.m__. These are plain-text files, as you would use in any other programming language. 
* **Live scripts** are interactive documents that combine MATLAB code with embedded output, formatted text, equations, and images in a single environment called the Live Editor. Their filenames end in **.mlx**. This format is great for doing homework in, since the live editor contains a basic word processor you can use to explain your work and answer any questions, and since the code and output is integrated into a single document that can be exported to PDF or Microsoft Word. For an introduction to live scripts, see [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html). There are tons of intro videos out there: Google them.

Be sure to delete sections of the final document not related to the exercises. Outputs should be turned in as a PDF.

## Add-on software options

In Assignments 1 & 4

* One part where you must graph a *direction field* (MATLAB Assignment 1, Textbook ยง1.1) or a *phase plane* (Assignment 4, Textbook ยง7.5). This is not built into MATLAB, so you'll have to install some additional software.
  * [Option 1:](option1) Add-on software for MATLAB.
     * __Pro:__ Uses MATLAB.
     * __Con:__ This is an old program that had some compatibility issues with recent versions of MATLAB, but I have managed to fix them.
  * [Option 2](option2): Slopes app for iPhone/iPad. Android version now available, with fewer features but enough to do the assignments.
     * __Pro:__ Output is gorgeous.
     * __Con:__ This is new software. It does not work perfectly sometimes. Plus, I really want you to learn MATLAB.
