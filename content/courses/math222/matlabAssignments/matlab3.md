MATLAB Live Scripts are a great way to do projects for class, incorporating both text, code, and outputs such as data printouts and graphs into a single document that can be output to a number of formats. For an introduction to live scripts, see [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html).
